Yo

I'm `Thibault-Pierre`, I'm currently living my "best life" in New-Zealand 
and struggling with everything this country has to offer.

My goals here:
- Find an interesting job
- Find the ring
- Go to Mordor
- ~~Drop it into the volcano~~ Take a selfie
- Go to Hobitton

---

I do have a very particular set of skills:
- Challenging driven: my bus driver's name is Challenge
- Curious: I'm always motivated about learning something fresh, like mint
- Proactive: I push the red button before telling me to (not) do it
- Persistent: I keep trying till the nukes are launched. Boom.
- Winese: Fluent.
