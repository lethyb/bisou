Hello people,

I'm starting this new project, writing some pieces of code and little stories.

Check out the [`about`][about] page.
Since it's about me, it's the most important page on the internets.
You will probably find my [`CV`][cv]{:target="_blank"} and my [`Github repos`][github]{:target="_blank"} there.

I'll try to post on a regular basis some [`IT suff`][stuff], nothing fancy though, and whenever I feel the need to spit on someone or to simply put down any wonderful ideas I will release my sorrowness in [`my dear diary`][blog].

You will learn so much around here that it will be your homepage. 

BISOU.
